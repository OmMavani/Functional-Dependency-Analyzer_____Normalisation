# Normalization-DBMS

# Functional Dependency Analyzer

1. Implemented a Python tool to find candidate keys and check normal form violations based on functional dependencies in a given database schema. The program analyzes the dependencies and provides insights into the normalization process.

2. Created a GUI which visualize various Normal form of functional dependency

3. Use Python to Create a program for functional check dependency and Create GUI using Streamlit library
